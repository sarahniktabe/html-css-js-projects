            <h1>Fellowship Point, by Alice Elliott Dark</h1>
            <p>Dark’s new novel explores female friendship between two women who are among the last shareholders of a large, undeveloped piece of Maine coastal land. Agnes Lee, 80, is an unmarried writer suffering from a bad case of writer’s block when the book opens, while Polly Wister has a devoted husband and children. The narrative follows each woman’s motivations to understand who they are to each other and themselves.</p>
